# Recipe App


I created this app with help from: Build a Recipe App With React | React Tutorial For Beginners - by DevEd

This project helped fortify more skills I need to know for writing with the react framework.\
This project also helped me by teaching me how i could fetch data from an api, for this api I retrieved recipes from edamam.




In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
